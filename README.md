Basic Time Tracking Application in Java { Tasker }
Description:
This project is a simple Java executable program designed to help users track the time they spend on various tasks. With this application, users can easily monitor their activities and gain insights into how they allocate their time throughout the day.

Key Features:
1. **Task Logging**: Users can log the tasks they are working on along with the start and end times.
2. **Time Calculation**: The program calculates the duration of each task based on the start and end times provided by the user.
3. **Summary Report**: Users can generate a summary report that shows the total time spent on each task.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a straightforward interface for users to input task details and view summary reports.
5. **Export Functionality**: Users can export their time-tracking data for further analysis or record-keeping purposes.

How to Use:
1. Run the Java executable file to launch the application.
2. Input the details of each task, including the task name, start time, and end time.
3. Optionally, generate a summary report to see the total time spent on each task.
4. Export the time-tracking data if needed for future reference or analysis.

This project serves as a foundation for building more advanced time-tracking applications with additional features such as data visualization, task categorization, and user authentication.
